Table: Delivery

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |

delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
 

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation: 
The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.
The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.
Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.

Scehma:

Create table If Not Exists Delivery (delivery_id int, customer_id int, order_date date, customer_pref_delivery_date date)
Truncate table Delivery
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('1', '1', '2019-08-01', '2019-08-02')
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('2', '2', '2019-08-02', '2019-08-02')
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('3', '1', '2019-08-11', '2019-08-12')
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('4', '3', '2019-08-24', '2019-08-24')
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('5', '3', '2019-08-21', '2019-08-22')
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('6', '2', '2019-08-11', '2019-08-13')
insert into Delivery (delivery_id, customer_id, order_date, customer_pref_delivery_date) values ('7', '4', '2019-08-09', '2019-08-09')

Solution:

with cte as (
select
*,
case when datediff(order_date,customer_pref_delivery_date)=0 then 'immediate' else 'scheduled' end as order_status
from delivery
),b as (
select*,
rank() over(partition by customer_id order by order_date ) as rnk
from cte
)
select round(
(select count(1) from b where order_status='immediate' and rnk=1) /
(select count(distinct customer_id) from b)*100,2) as immediate_percentage
